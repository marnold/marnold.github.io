Matt Arnold is writing in the third person because that is what `they` say `you` should do in biographic information. He thinks that whomever these `they` people are then they should find some more productive use of their time


### Grammar Jokes? Seriously?
Yes.

### Ok but, Who are you?

Good question, Glad you asked. 
I am Matt Arnold. A computer programmer who sometimes moonlights as a disability rights activist, and hoobyist historian of technology. You've reached the place where I put my Resume and Brag about stuff I've done. I occasionally blog about things that interest me.
